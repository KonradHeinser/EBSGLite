        <description>Carriers of this gene have their fertility shortened by a factor of 1.25. This means they will still mostly follow the same curve, but it will take far fewer years to reach peaks and lows.\n\nUnlike the extension genes, the starting point will not move with the rest of the curve,  which means the curve will both start and end later than math would suggest(i.e. shortening by 2 puts male start and ends at 14 and 52 instead of the 7 and 45 the math says based on the normal 14 and 90).\n\nThis is intended for xenotypes that have shorter lifespans for whatever reason.</description>

        <description>Carriers of this gene have their fertility elongated by a factor of 2. This means they will still follow the same curve, but it will take many more years to reach peaks and lows.\n\nUnlike the shortening genes, the starting point will move with the rest of the curve.\n\nThey will still lose immunity gain speed due to age at the normal rate, so if this is to be attached to an long lived xenotype, it is recommended to include an immunity gain speed.\n\nIf you have Expanded Archite Genes and More Cell Stability Genes, this would cover the lifespan of a xenotype with major archite cell stability. Covers the 200%-250% lifespan factor range (age easily reaches 160-200 years).</description>
