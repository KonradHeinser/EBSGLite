Expanded Biotech Style Genes(EBSG) is the step beyond [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2985153870]More Biotech Style Genes[/url]. Where that series sought to expand ranges that already exist, this series seeks to add ranges that should exist. You get gene ranges that alter sleep fall rate, but why not a range for changing the rate it recovers? If you can have fire resistance genes, why not have genes to resist other types of damage like frostbite and acid?

Well now both those questions will be solved, and more. This is a much lighter variation of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3020821838]Expanded Biotech Style Genes - All in One[/url] that trims that mod down from the over 500 in that mod to about 100. If you are looking to replace the All in One, you should start a new save as this removes a lot of the stuff that it its heavier version adds. Most of the genes in this mod are the 2 and 4 met versions of the genes from that mod.

There won't be individual mods for any of the gene types inside this one, nor will there be 1.4 compatability because I haven't tested it and your game should be up to date anyway when starting a new game.
